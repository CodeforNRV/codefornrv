    <h1>WalkBlacksburg</h1>
    <p>WalkBlacksburg is a brand new app created by the all volunteer group Code for New River Valley in coordination with the Blacksburg Police Department and the No Hokie Left Behind™ initiative. The app shows an easy to understand map of Blacksburg, with streets color-coded as red, yellow, or green based on a number of factors, such as whether there are sidewalks or streetlights. Additional features allow you to see if there has been recent crime along your route and provides an estimated safety score for Google’s suggested walking route. Download the app, give us feedback, and become part of our group at codefornrv.org/WalkBlacksburg! </p>
